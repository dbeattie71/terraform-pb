regions/region/forwardingRules/forwardingRule
Note that this can only be used when the destinationRange is a public (non-RFC 1918) IP CIDR range.

You can specify this as a full or partial URL. For example:

* 'projects/project/zones/zone/instances/instance'
* 'zones/zone/instances/instance'
* Just the instance name, with the zone in 'next_hop_instance_zone'.
