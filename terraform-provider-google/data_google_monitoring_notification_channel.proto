This makes it possible to disable delivery of notifications to a particular channel without removing the channel from all alerting policies that reference the channel.

permissible and required labels are specified in the
NotificationChannelDescriptor corresponding to the type field.

the sensitive_labels block, but cannot be configured in both places.

resource. This block contains the labels which contain secrets or passwords so that they can be marked
sensitive and hidden from plan output. The name of the field, eg: password, will be the key
in the 'labels' map in the api request.

Credentials may not be specified in both locations and will cause an error. Changing from one location
to a different credential configuration in the config will require an apply to update state.

To change the value of this field, you must call VerifyNotificationChannel.
